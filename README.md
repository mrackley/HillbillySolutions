# HillbillySolutions

A compilation of various scripts I've used over the years. 

Documentation will be scarce and all these are solutions are provided as-is without warranty. Use at your own risk. 

If you are still doing script injection using CEWP's and Script Editor Web Parts and are using SharePoint Online you should really be using the SharePoint Framework for this type of development. 

Important notes (as I think of them)
* All scripts referenced locally are assumed to be stored in the Site Assets Document Library
* All scrtpts have been tested in Classic mode in SharePoint Online but should work on most versions of SharePoint. 
* I would love to offer all the free support in the world, but I simply don't have the time. If you are having problems getting
  a solution to work, try google first... I promise all these scripts worked... at some point... :)
